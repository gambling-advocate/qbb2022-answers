# Part 1: Getting, Exploring, and Commenting on the HiC Pro analysis results
For dCTCF there are 92% valid interactions.
For ddCTCF there are 88% valid interactions. 

Dangling end pairs constitute the majority of the invalid 3C pairs. This means there was an issue during the ligation step of the process and the data can't count.

#Part 2: Exploring the results by plotting heatmaps

Start bin 343067
End bin 343208

I was unable to see the highlighted differences.
It seems as though seqeuncing depth has decreased the interaction in the highlighted region we were looking at?
The highlighted signal indicates strong interaction between those insulator sites.
