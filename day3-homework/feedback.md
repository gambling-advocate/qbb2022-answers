Overall this looks good. Your plots look correct. You are missing the code that you used to plot the data colored by the metadata. While not required, it is nice if you include the commands you ran on the command line to do these data manipulations. Think of it as showing your work. Also, it's worth toying with formatting when plotting when you have issues like a legend covering data. But all in all, well done. Keep it up!
