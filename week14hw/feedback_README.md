This is a good start, Kaven! Here's a few more things we need before this is complete:
1. I'm not entirely sure your ktImportText command would work as you have it. You usually can't use wildcards in output names, because the program doesn't know what you want to name the output. In this case it would just create one file with the wildcard character in the name. But, you have the overal structure right, and this would actually create a correctly formated output file, sooooo don't worry about it. (no points deducted)
2. Answer to Question 2 (-0.5 point)
3. Code for the alignment step (-1.5 point)
4. Code for metaBAT2 (-1 point)
5. Answer and code for Quesiton 3 (-3 points)
6. Answer and code for Question 4 (-1.5 point)

Again, good start. Keep working on it
