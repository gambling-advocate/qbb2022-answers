## Week 5 -- 10 points possible

_ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _  = _ points out of 10

1. Filter reads, Call peaks, and intersect peaks across Sox2 replicates (0.33 points each)

2. Find the number of total peaks and overlapping peaks for Klf4 and Sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)

3. scale bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

4. crop bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

5. python script for plotting


6. 4 panel plot of read pile ups


7. motif finding sort intersected sox2 replicate narrow peak by 5th columm, keep first 300 lines, awk command for reformatting (0.33 each)

8. use samtools faidx to extract peak sequences and meme-chip to perform motif finding (0.5 each)

9. download and unpack motif database

10. match profiles from tomtom for klf4 and sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)
